The span tag is used to group inline-elements in a document. Because an element is inline it will render as a single unbroken text flow. Inline Elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clear an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area around the border. The margin is transparent

The text-align property specifies the horizontal alignment of text in an element

Position

Relative
Position relative is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top right bottom and left properties of a relatiely positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position..

Absolute
Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. You can use left right top and bottom with position absolute. Any element that is position: absolute automatically has display: block.
